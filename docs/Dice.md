# Dice

The Dice Class was created, as quite a few processes in the game depend on events of chance. To best control this, a variety of 6 and 20 sided dies are used at various points.

The class should be self-explanatory.

## Other Notes

* At one point I had planned to use a different RNG (Xoroshiro) but the default PRNG in Godot (xorshift128) is more than sufficient enough for my needs.
