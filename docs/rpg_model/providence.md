# Providence

**Providence** is a primary statistic that serves as the measure of a player's fate in the game world. The higher it is, the more the odds that good luck will favor them, in the form of critical hits, per-level bonuses, benefits in conversations and trade, and so forth.

Like all Primary Statistics, once set, it is final.
