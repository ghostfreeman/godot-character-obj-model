# Strength

**Strength** is a primary statistic that serves as the measure of a player's strength. Strength is a measurement of *Attack Power*, *Agility*, *Inventory Capacity*, and *environmental resistance*. Strength also serves as a secondary value to defining other derived statistics.

Like all Primary Statistics, once set, it is final.
